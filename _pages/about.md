        <p class="lead">I am a Deep Learning Engineer with a passion for developing innovative AI/ML solutions to tackle complex, real-world challenges. My work focuses on the intersection of cutting-edge research and practical application, from optimizing on-device models to engineering large-scale predictive systems.</p>

        <p>I recently graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering, specializing in AI and Machine Learning, from the Vellore Institute of Technology. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals and a deep understanding of modern AI paradigms.</p>

        <p>My professional experience includes impactful internships where I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects. As an AI/ML Engineer Intern at <strong>SlateMate, IIT Madras</strong>, I contributed to a multi-layered content moderation framework and optimized models for edge deployment. At the <strong>National Institute of Wind Energy</strong>, I led the design of predictive models for wind energy forecasting, even engineering a Temporal Fusion Transformer from scratch.</p>

        <h4>My Work & Research</h4>
        <p>I am driven by a desire to build robust and scalable systems. My publications and projects reflect this, with a focus on areas like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automated Safety Compliance:</strong> I was the first author on an IEEE publication for an autonomous edge AI system for industrial safety, deploying a high-precision YOLO model on NVIDIA Jetson.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockchain for Secure Data:</strong> I have designed and developed decentralized systems for securing patient health records and enhancing patient triage systems using technologies like Ethereum and IPFS.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced AI Models:</strong> My project work includes enhancing Large Language Models like Mistral 7B and developing systems for traffic management and malware detection.</li>
        </ul>
