Consider this blog as my notes for LLM finetuning from the article [The Ultimate Guide to Fine-Tuning LLMs from Basics to Breakthroughs](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.13296v1). I found this to be the best comprehensive work on LLM-Finetuning, even though I think a few more could have been added to it, which we will discuss later.
Also note that this post will only have things which I consider are important and have left out all the redundant part.
