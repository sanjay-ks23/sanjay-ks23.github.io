Villareal Home

This game will give me a good perspective as to where we actually are, not a rivalry, but against a good attacking team.

Similar starting line-up with just Valverde in Right back. 

I have an opinion on our starting lineups. We should have found our starting lineup by now. We need to find it quickly, with the clasico coming in a few weeks.

A pretty solid start to the half, confident on the ball and comfortable in possession. Ceballos is the only one who has started poorly and looks clunkier than usual.

Feels like a lack of intensity. Just walking around slowly, and why does it look like I am watching the game in 0.5 speed?
Great wingplay from both the wingers to get the wingbacks on yellow.
Vini is playing like Vini till now. We need to finish our chances.

The build-up from the wings has been great, but nothing from the middle. Arda needs to move across the middle channels and not to the right wing.

I have a doubt, since the start of the season, have we scored in the first 25 mins? I think Ceballos has an agenda to play the ball forward. Just look at this dudes first touches, man, he seriously cannot take a touch (I am talking about the Argentine shit  if you didn't know). Why does it look slow in the middle of the pitch? I don't want our first goal in a game to be a penalty, at least for this game.

Courtois, what a legend!!!!
Just one single pass through the middle and our entire team is undone. And in just a few minutes, the same thing happens again, we push way too high and a lot of numbers up the pitch and don't really use them even as a decoy. We are taking the game by the scruff of the neck.

The chance missed by Villareal is a classic case of what happens when you have  time in front of the goal.

There is not a lot to say in this game, and not even tactically.

2nd Half:
Vini is viniying. A very big deflection, but we will take it.

In minute 56, our build-up before the shot was amazing.One twos everywhere, all across the pitch.

Just a really boring game, straightforward, didn't expect Villareal to sit back and counter, they did have good chances, but the overall consensus should be clear. Why is Vini taking the pen?? Wtf mannn, he is not a good pen taker. I still haven't seen the action that was given as a penalty.

Belllingham gives us dimensionality that we dearly need.
Great finish from the edge of the box, someone wasn't tracking his man Where is Cama going? He was marking him and then left him to go defend a cross.

Should have been straightforward, but we do tend to make it difficult for ourselves, I think this is kink for the players, to fight hard and "suffer" until the 90''.

And what is Huijsen's obsession with passing in the middle lane when there are 3 players in that exact channel? He has been doing that in most of the matches.

Not worthy of a second yellow card for the player. Really harsh, and Mbappe gets his goal.

Goodbye, guys, the game is done. 

the big one 
Madrid vs Barcelona

I dont need to say anything, this is the big one

we start wth a 4-2-1-3 , please just win guys.It will be difficult but atleast give it all for the badge.

We will understand as the game goes on how we setup.
It was offside i GUESS, BUT THAT FINISH IS SOMETHING. It was kicked by fermin but if this is given offside, then I am going to be pissed. It was given offside.

We are setup in a mid block, and we are getting really good chances, but have been afaris of them, that is what is holding us back 

THe first half has been pretty eventful, but the aqctual play has been poor from both teams, they both look vulnerable in the back.

We go into the secon half, I am more worried, because we tend to drop  the effort usually near the 60th min, hopefully they do nt do that today.

We are so shit, we try to play out from th eback, but when we have the ball in th edeep end, we dont get numbers in midfield for any options, so we end up losing posession.

Why are we parking the bus man.
fucking embarrasing to do this, for nearly the last 30 mins
