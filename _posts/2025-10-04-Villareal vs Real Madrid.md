Villareal Home

This game will give me a good perspective as to where we actually are, not a rivalry, but against a good attacking team.

Similar starting line-up with just Valverde in Right back. 

I have an opinion on our starting lineups. We should have found our starting lineup by now. We need to find it quickly, with the clasico coming in a few weeks.

A pretty solid start to the half, confident on the ball and comfortable in possession. Ceballos is the only one who has started poorly and looks clunkier than usual.

Feels like a lack of intensity. Just walking around slowly, and why does it look like I am watching the game in 0.5 speed?
Great wingplay from both the wingers to get the wingbacks on yellow.
Vini is playing like vini till now. We need to finish our chances.

The build-up from the wings has been great, but nothing from the middle. Arda needs to move across the middle channels and not to the right wing.

I have a doubt, since the start of the season have we scored in the first 25 mins. I think ceballos has some agenda to play the ball forward. Just look at this dudes first touches man, he seriously cannot take a touch (I am tallking about the argentine shit  if you didnt know) Why does it look slow in the middle of the pitch, I dont want our first goal in a game to be a penalty atleast for this game.

Courtois what a legend!!!!
just one single pass through the middlle and our entire team is undone.and in justa few mins the same thing happens again, we push way to high and a lot of numbers up the pitch and dont really use them even as a decoy. we are taking the game by the scruff of the neck.

The chance missed by villareal is a cllassic case of what happens when you have  time in front of goal.

There is not a lot to say in this game, and nt even tactically.

2nd Half:
Vini is viniying. A very big deflection , but we will take it.

In min 56, our build up before the shot was amazing.One twos everywhere all across the pitch.

Just a really boring game, straightforward , didnt expect villareal to sit back and counter, they did have good chances but the overall concensus should be clear. Why is vini taking the pen?? wtf mannn, he is not a good pen taker. I still havent seen the actionn that was given as a penalty.

Belllingham gives us dimensionality that we dearly need.
Great finish from the edge of the box, someone wasnt tracking his man, where is cama going, he was marking him and then left him to go defend a cross.

SHould have been straightforward, but we do tend to make it difficult for ourselves, I think this is kink for the players , to fight hard and "suffer" until the 90''.

And what is huijsen's obession with passing in the middle lane when rthere are 3 players in that exact channel ,he has been doing that in most of the matches.

Not worthy of a second yellow card for the player.Really harsh and mbappe gets his goal.

Goodbye guys the game is done.
