Soceidad away.

we again start with a 4-3-3 on paper. With Arda guler likely to be a player that connec

It has been 2 mins and La Real are already letting mbappe run through the central channel withoout any restriction, and he sets up arda, The goal is under review and.... Yeah iut has been rules out for a tight call.

Im honestly surprised valverde and trent are not starting, trent I oculd understand but dont give me that ceballos breaks line with his passes and valverde doesnt. It might even be true but ceballos is ceballos.

I dont understand us not going for any physical duels higher up the pitch, this has been the case for all our previous games as well.

My mistake, the commentator just let me know, valverde just played with uruguay and I guess that is why Mastantuano is also not playing.I am loving the energy and the switches of wings by player when they see an opportunity.

MIn 10, was my concern when we play against tough opposition or atleast a aggressive pressing one , one simple pass and the high line is done.I mean, while typing this La-Real just made a blunder with mbappe on the pitch a back pass without looking which turned out to be inch perfect through pass for Mbappe.

This defense from Sociedad is atrocious. Vini looks better than all of last season which is a great takeaway. I am still worried about our set piece/dead ball situations, we don't to track our runners.

I came across a post that seemed to reciprocate amongst our fanbase, Carreras is just the left back Carvajal, really solid. The press in min 18 to win the ball back was really good , Intelligent and not just people running randomly.

The set up is more similar to a 4-2-3-1, with arda playing behind mabppe and vini and brahim, playing more like winger-midfielders. I get that huijsen is good but he seriiously needs to stop making difficult passes through the central lanes and losing them unnecesarrily.

Tchouameni trasmits calmness and is always an option but only when the pass is near the half way line, on the otehr hand our attacking set pieces are elite and two great saves from remiro.

I mean the game has been ruined, by yet again a stupid decision made in game by a player, of course the attacker is going to look for a foul and flop down.

Now the structure is going to be with tchouameni as centre back, and arda playing a bit deeper. The momentum has shifted tremendously and I wont be surprised to see them getting a goal before half-time.  

He stepped up unnecesarrily and got caught out by a hoofed up ball and he has been doing this for all the games. Need some control in the game missing modric now. Half-time needed now or a scrappy goal would do. 

What even was that goal and Mbappe is playing like a man possessed. Trying to win the ball high up the pitch, if a man runs at their defense they shit their pants. I can't even anaylyse our structure right now, we feel like we play a man down defensively but are way to aggresive in offensive press and number up the pitch. 

Half-Time analysis:

Both teams have had similar possession but the attacking threat from madrid has just been better than sociedad who often messed up thier final passes, but they did break away from the press of madrid quite easily in a lot of occasions.

Player performances:
Vini's heatmap shows a lot about how deep he is playing which I do get because our line is high and when he is a bit deeper and away from the goal  the right back is isolated with him, creating a overload with Carreras as well, more often than not which is not tracked by Gueded, who is playing a lot more centrally.
No opinions on brahim, he has been stupid in a lot of scenarios as always. Carvajal solid as always same as Carreras. I am stuck in between for Guler, in temrs of his position I feel like he needs to play deeper and at the same time he creates for mbappe which is turning out to be a good partnership, Mbappe- No words!

Structurally: Need to analyse more. We look like a dilemma to put in a few words, but still a lot more structured and have patterns compared to last season

Honestly great sub by Xabi, bringing on valverde for brahim

Second Half:
Started a bit more deeper defensively , looks like a mid line rather than a deep one. W e caught life there, I have never seen a ball hitting both the posts while passing through the goal line completely. To my defense during the live it seemed like th eplayed moved through the goal line. 

This is how we played the whole of last season. Another stupid passage of play, not the actual penalty but the way we let them waylk through our defense before i., conceded a penalty now. Honeslty we deserved it.

Sociedad 1-2 Madrid, Cannot be passive now the goal cushion is gone.

We are just building pressure on ourselves, by giving away the ball right after they give it to us. Honestly, out of words for mbappe. Haven't been able to understand anything for the past 10 min.

Take vini off man, wtf. We need tchouameni in midfield, this is going to be  a grind for the next 25 mins. Fran Garcia i sgetting instructions from Xabi, I think he is going to play a 5 back system.  

He has taken off vini, and tchouameni in midfield which is great news. BUt we are still playing very stupidly, like arda playing a hoss pass to the centre of the pitch with nobody in sight. 

I am going to play afun game, RSA gave us the ball in 71:54, let me check how quickly we give it back to them...72:34 which is quite good, considering the circumstances. and that too only becuase the ball was bouncing around. 
ANOTHER PLAYER TO BE NOTED MILITAO. ALL ROUND PERFORMANCE. 

Why do we keep giving away the ball stupidly, now carvajal does it. Just 14 more mins until stoppage time, 

Got the ball at 78:17 lost it at 78:23, WHat is actually going on that too from a throw in, Route one deoesnt work with these players in our attack. I really want modric now.

We are playing some pbrain dead football now. and he is bringing on trent now, If Xabi thinks trent has to wait to start and prove himself, then vini should be the player benched every game. Time is running out for the guy, I love him but he is playing at a bad level for a year now.

THere is nothing more to anaylse in this game, I am dying here.
