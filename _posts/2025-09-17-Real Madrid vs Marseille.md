Good evening, we start with a similar 4-3-3 on paper with mulitple different players

Again great start, with Rodrygo and mastantuano on with Mbappe, and Valverde starts today. We actuakky start with trent today, but seems to have done his hamstring after 4 mins on the pitch, really unlucky. Hope it is just a few weeks and nothing more than that. 

I have to really emphasize, a great start to the game.SOrry if the analysis is less I can't take my eyes off the screen. We have had 8 attempts at goa in the first 15 mins, need to build on it and not become passive after this. I can finally catch a breath.

Initial thoughts, we are playing some high knowledgeable stuff, when ti comes to pressing as a team. After all that, we trail from a lapse in concentration from arda , just pass the pall brother. 

Great play by rodrygo, he has had a good start to the game. Now it is on Mbappe. 
1-1, Now we need to concentrate the whole way and convert our chances, marseille are there for the taking. 

Valverde is stupid for making that pass which led to tchouameni getting a yellow. THe guys has to pick up his paces and not just moan when he does something stupid which apparently is every 5 mins.

Why the fuck do we intent to keep doing stupid stuff, got lucky with a miss from Auba.

Tchouameni is seemingly marking kondongbia, whihc shouldnt make sense, but actually does when you see the positioning of him, Because, Xabi has to have done his homework , kondongiba is usually the first lane carrier, he doesnt pass but drives it through the intial press. Tchouameni doesnt give him the extra yard.

Regardless of the score I would say this has been our best first half in this season,  we could and should have scored atleast 2 goals regardless of the penalty.

Tactical analysis:

Our wingbacks have been amazing, and all over the pitch, the tuck in when tchouameni goes up to mark, which I expected either valverde or huijsen to do, and that too when marseille tries to stretch the pitch woith their two wingers, who hacve made the most out o fthe opportunities they have got. The left flank should stay the same in terms of personel.

THEY BOTH TUCK IN INCREDIBLY WELL and when needed, but valverde and Arda need to pull their weight, tchouameni is doing all the heavy lifting, just for the other midfielders to be retarded. If only we had someone like a vitinha, which was what happened during the first 20 mins of the game, where you caan see valverde moving across the channels and connecting play whereas, arda tried to do the same vertically, by connecting the midfield with the attack.

Huijsne, steps up too aggressively, which is needed , but when tchouameni is high up tthe pitch, when our centre back pulls away from the line, it tends to leave aspace, which is often covered by carreras brilliantly or even tchouameni drops  in some scenarios where huijsen presses aggressively, I wouldnt call it man marking , but lets just say he marks thefurthest forward when he drops deep to link up play.

It is bad with valverde, because he doesnt really go staright into a challenge, he is passive when it comes to going for a duel and that is largely due to our previous season, where was was pushed to be passive to maintain some sort of structure.

I have got nothing to say about mbappe and rodrygo and even mastantuano aprt from the chance he missed at the end of teh half and also I have to mention his first touches, which do seem to  give him the initial momentum to get into his stride, but is often pick pocketed, in possession due to this.

I did want to get into somehting as well, at the start of the half we played some inteligent football, because we held onto the ball and passed it after llooking at the options, or by assessing it before receiving th eball ,but as the half progressed, we started to push the passes, trying one touch ases where it was not really necessary.

Saying all this, I do expect us to win, but I wouldnt say that we are not gettable, we surely are.

Second Half:

I need to stop seeing courtois, hoofing up the ball, to our non physical,small and nimble forwards.

why does arda think he has a lot more time that he actually does. I have to mention the great challenge from the marseille defender for the tackle in mbappe. 

I have been holding onto this, we look a bit ameteurish in all aspects not particularly in the footballing aspect. I want a goal in the next 10 mins.

Now I want to see how our structure changes, with kondongbia off the pitch.
This is where my analysis stops in min 70. I cant type after this.
