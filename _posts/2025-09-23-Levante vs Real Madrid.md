Levante Away

We start with a  4-3-3, Tchouameni had been rested, which i sth eone I was waiting to see, let us see how it pans out. We start with the same front three, with ceballos instead of Tchoua, and fran instead of carvajal.

We are playing a 3 back system, with carreras the left hand center back and asensio being the right centre back.  Not a  good start, we look shaky at the back.  I just realised Levante lost to barca 3-2  in this stadium, why exactly are we doing this rotation.

The players are not sure when to step up in the press, but they are understanding where the ther players will be. The commentator just said that the pitch has been over watered. which is something uite few teams do in laliga, to put of teams.
 
It has been 18 minutes, but nothing to analyse bar one thing, we miss a presence in the midfield. 

When attacking we have a 5 men attacking the box. Vinicius is dropping deeper to be more invloved, taking on players. What a goal from Vini!!!!!!!!!!
Great piece of improvissation. 

What I noticed, is when vinicius moves Mbappe doesnt, and for these past few games, when mbappe was moving,dropping deeper and moving across channels horizontally. Carreras looks out of position.THings that came naturally for him from left back, looks complicated now.

Great counter from madrid, and a even better pickout from vinicius, and a great finish from Mastantuano for his first Madrid goal. 2-0.

Carreras should have passed it to Mbappe there, would have been 3-0 and game done. 

Levante are really stuggling to clear their lines, or even close down players, might be downto the fact that their centre halves are occupied pretty much entirely on Mbappe, which is justifiable. and they overload with the 5 players in the box when attacking. Their inital hope was because of turnovers high in the pitch and an absence of tchouameni in the middle of the park.

Should have been more than 2 goals, but we are taken aback at the hesitant nature of the levante defense.

2-nd Half:

Swithcing between flanks have been really hurting us. Mastantuano really needs to figure out his first touch, really shit.
Game on 2-1, really poor defending from Madrid.

As the game goes on, why do we always insist on making shit decisions, in every single game. Again a good transition and Mbapper wins a penalty, and btw if he misses it my hypothesis will be proved I guess. Haha. He panenkas the keeper. 

Btw the guy should have been sent off, he made a really harsh tackle on vinicius a few mins later , he takes down mbappe in the penalty bo. I dont know why it isnt another yellow.Mbappe scores another in a matter of mins!!!
Mbappeeeee!!!!!!! 
4-1. Great pickout from Arda.
Valverde has been pretty good this game, best game so far this season. He has moved across the pitch, connected the flanks, and is a outlet everytime we need him.

The game ended as soon as mbappe scored the 4th.
