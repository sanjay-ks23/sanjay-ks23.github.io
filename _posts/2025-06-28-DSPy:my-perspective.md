This blog is predominantly my undersatnding of the Build and Optimize Agentic Apps with DSPy and MLflow course from DeepLearning AI. 
The  course has been seperated into four main categories:
   ### Introduction to DSPy.
   ### DSPy Programming-Signatures and MOdules.
   ### Debug YOur DSPy Agent with MLflow Tracing.
   ### And finally, Opttimizing Agents with DSPy Optimizer.
This course talks about building AI programs with DSPy. 

## So what exactly is DSPy?

    DSPy is a GenAI authoring framework, that simplifies the develpopment of GenAI applications.
    As of now the use cases are as follows:
          1) RAG systems
          2) Chain of thought prompting
          3) Structuring the response ouput generated( like JSON)
          4) LLM pipelines for agnets or tools

### So what does this all these mean you ask? 
    To answer that we need to go back a few years, 20222 to be precise, to understand the problem that led the creation of DSPy. If you can recall it was around this time we all got introduced to CHAT-GPT and other Gen-AI models, for me personally it was a revelation as I was in my college and suddenly I could compelete my assignments wihtout the help of anybody, we wont talk about the repercussions of doing so. Now along with these models came the development of **compound AI systems**. These are systems that has multiple modules and each of these modules handles a subtask which in turn makes LLM calls. Dont worry I know you found it hard to understand the last sentence, I did too, so we will take it slowly.
