This blog is predominantly my undersatnding of the Build and Optimize Agentic Apps with DSPy and MLflow course from DeepLearning AI. 
The  course has been seperated into four main categories:
Introduction to DSPy.
DSPy Programming-Signatures and MOdules.
Debug YOur DSPy Agent with MLflow Tracing.
And finally, Opttimizing Agents with DSPy Optimizer.
This course talks about building AI programs with DSPy.
