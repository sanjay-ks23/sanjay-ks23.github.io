My live analysis of what I watched during the game today

I want to do this for the whole season and depending on how it goes we will then decide. I am really excited for this season.

For the first time, I have seen a player pick out Mbappe's run since last season started.
The buildup has changed a lot. we are a lot more composed no more hoofing up the ball from the defence.
But it does feel like the team needs more matches together, still feels a bit clunky to defend llong balls
Vini is passing the ball back does takeon anyone
I feel ike the ball is bobbling a lot the pitch doesnt sem right.

I know the team is parking the bus but the way we build doesnt feel natural feels like we are pushing a lot of stuff, which doesnt need to be done. We feel slow not upto match fitness which is expected for the first game of the season.

One positive is Militao looks good, just as I was saying that brother took 2 mins to kick a ball. Still stupid while anticipating when the striker goes deep to get the ball, the same old stuff

We need to stop this short corner and free-kick stuff, you can see that it is etched that Vini only pays with that everyone against us mentality.
Mbappe and Huijsen have been the only sparks in this half. There is no wingplay; the wingers are too pedestrian.
