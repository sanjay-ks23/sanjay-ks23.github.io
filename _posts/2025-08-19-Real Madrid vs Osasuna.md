## Match Summary

A brief overview of the match, including the final score, key events (goals, red cards), and the general flow of the game.

## Tactical Analysis

This section can be broken down into subsections for different tactical aspects of the game.

### Offensive Setup

*The buildup has changed a lot. we are a lot more composed no more hoofing up the ball from the defence. For the first time, I have seen a player pick out Mbappe's run since last season started. There is no wingplay; the wingers are too pedestrian.*

*I know the team is parking the bus but the way we build doesnt feel natural feels like we are pushing a lot of stuff, which doesnt need to be done. We feel slow not upto match fitness which is expected for the first game of the season.*

**(You can add images here to illustrate formations or player movements. For example, a screenshot of the team's shape.)**

### Defensive Structure

*It does feel like the team needs more matches together, still feels a bit clunky to defend llong balls.*

*One positive is Militao looks good, just as I was saying that brother took 2 mins to kick a ball. Still stupid while anticipating when the striker goes deep to get the ball, the same old stuff.*

**(Add any relevant statistics here, like tackles, interceptions, etc.)**

## Player Performances
